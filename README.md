# MemCard-Pro-Packs
PS1 Memory Card MCD Packs Ready for MemCardPro

This is a repository of PS1 Memory Card Files for MemCard Pro + XStation Users - the file names are renamed to allow the MemCardPro to automatically load the correct Virtual Mem Card when used with Xstation

Instructions 
---------------------------------------------
Download the MEMCARD PRO PACK.7z - unpack it into your "MemoryCards" folder in your MemCard Pro SD card. 
Make sure Xstation is on the latest Firmware - virtual memory cards should automatically load when xstation detects the corresponding game.
Be sure to back up any save files for the games that you already have on your card or rename the files so they dont clash with the ones in this pack. 
Remember you may have up to 8 Mem cards per game 
----------------------------------------------

GAMES are USA versions unless stated if you have any interesting saves you would like added to this pack
slide into my DMs on twitter @thejohnperry

all of the credit for these saves needs to go to the original individuals who created them and uploaded them to GameFAQs and other sites  

for individual saves I have included the names of the original uploaders but if you would like your save removed please let me know and I will remove it 

you can also report any broken saves or files that are not as described and I will amend or remove
