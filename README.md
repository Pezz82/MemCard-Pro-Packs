# MemCard-Pro-Packs
PS1 Memory Card MCD Packs Ready for MemCardPro

This is a repository of PS1 Memory Card Files for MemCard Pro + XStation Users - the file names are renamed to allow the MemCardPro to automatically load the correct Virtual Mem Card when used with Xstation

Instructions 
---------------------------------------------
place folder in your "MemoryCards" folder in your MemCard Pro SD card 
make sure Xstation is on the latest Firmware - virtual memory cards should automatically load when xstation detects the corresponding game 
----------------------------------------------

GAMES are USA versions unless stated if you have any interesting saves you would like added to this pack
slide into my DMs on twitter @thejohnperry

all of the credit for these saves needs to go to the original individuals who created them and uploaded them to GameFAQs and other sites  

for individual saves I have included the names of the original uploaders but if you would like your save removed please let me know and I will remove it 

you can also report any broken saves or files that are not as described and I will amend or remove
